ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to **SuCoS** (**J**ui**C**e**S**, in Brazilian Portuguese), the one of the fastest Static Site Generator out there! ðŸš€

> **DISCLAIMER**: **SuCoS** is in a **ALPHA state**! Please do not use for ANY real site for now. Prepare to be entertained by unexpected behaviors! ðŸŽ¢

## Install

All the [Releases](https://gitlab.com/sucos/sucos/-/releases) for Linux, Windows are a single executable! Just download and use.

## Usage

First, navigate to the **SuCoS** folder, then, run the following command:

```sh
SuCoS <YOUR_SITE_PATH>
```

```sh
SuCoS.exe <YOUR_SITE_PATH>
```

if `<YOUR_SITE_PATH>` not present, it will default to current folder.

Watch in awe as **SuCoS** creates a static site from your input files, or as it possibly implodes (with a 50/50 chance).

If all goes well (fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž), you'll have a shiny new static website in the `public` folder.

## Build Requirements

**SuCoS** is built with **DotNet 8**, and the latest C# speed and features!

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/sucos/sucos.git # or git@gitlab.com:sucos/sucos.git
cd SuCoS
dotnet build # or `build.sh clean restore compile`
```
