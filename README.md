**S**tatic site generator
**u**sing
**CS**harp

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to **SuCoS** (Juices), the most delightfully wacky and laughably unstable Static Site Generator out there! ðŸŽ‰

> **DISCLAIMER**: **SuCoS** is in a **SUPER ALPHA version**, and we mean SUPER! Please do not use for ANY real site for now. Prepare to be entertained by unexpected behaviors! ðŸŽ¢

## Usage

First, navigate to the **SuCoS** folder, then, run the following command:

```bash
SuCoS <YOUR_SITE_PATH>
```

if `<YOUR_SITE_PATH>` not present, it will default to current folder.

Watch in awe as **SuCoS** creates a static site from your input files, or as it possibly implodes (with a 50/50 chance).

If all goes well (fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž), you'll have a shiny new static website in the `public` folder.
