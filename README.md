ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to SuCoS, the most delightfully wacky and laughably unstable Static Site Generator out there! ðŸŽ‰

The vision is to be a close substitute of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but written in **C#**. As a vision, I will dream as much as I can.

> **DISCLAIMER**: SuCoS is in a **SUPER ALPHA version**, and we mean SUPER! Please do not use for ANY real site for now. Prepare to be entertained by unexpected behaviors! ðŸŽ¢

## Usage

First, navigate to the SuCoS folder.
Chris Kibble
Then, run the following command:
```bash
SuCoS --source YOUR_SITE_PATH
```

if `--source` not present, it will default to current folder.

Watch in awe as SuCoS creates a static site from your input files, or as it possibly implodes (with a 50/50 chance).

If all goes well (fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž), you'll have a shiny new static website in the `public` folder.

## License

This piece of software is brought to you under the [MIT license](LICENSE), because we believe in the power of sharing (and bug fixing together).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunomassa/sucos.git

dotnet build
```
